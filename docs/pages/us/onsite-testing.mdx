# Onsite testing

This section provides operating recommendations for testing station setup, staffing testing stations, and student pre-registration based on field experience from successful K-12 RapidTest rollouts.

## Staffing a testing site

To quickly process patients for assurance testing, DataRobot recommends setting up two stations: one station to scan student test QR codes and another for test administration and result entry.

## Pre-registering students

The application requires patient information to report results, so students are encouraged to pre-register online prior to testing. The online form generates and emails the student a QR code that can be scanned by a test operator before administering the test. If a student is not pre-registered, all patient information must be manually entered.
