# Onsite testing

This section provides operating recommendations for testing station setup, staffing testing stations, and student pre-registration based on field experience from successful K-12 RapidTest rollouts.

## Setting up a testing station

## Staffing a testing site

To quickly process patients for assurance testing, DataRobot recommends setting up two stations:

1. Station 1 scans a QR code to assign a test to a student in the system and administers a test.
2. Station 2 scans the QR code again to add the student's information to their assigned test.

After 15 minutes, test results are ready, at which point any available test operator can scan the student's QR code to enter the results of the test into the system.

## Pre-registering students

The application requires patient information to report results, so students are encouraged to pre-register online prior to testing. The online form generates and emails the student a QR code that can be scanned by a test operator before administering the test. If a student is not pre-registered, all patient information must be entered manually by a test operator.

To pre-register online, go to register.pennrapidtest.org and complete both pages of the form.

When you are done, click **Submit** to be emailed a QR code. Print or screenshot the QR code before arriving at school, so it is ready to be scanned by a test operator.

Note: If you do not have a driver's license, pre-registration is required.
