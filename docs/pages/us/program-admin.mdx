# RapidTest for program administrators

Program administrators are responsible for worktin with schools and coordinating testing programs. The RapidTest web application allows them to manage test operator accounts and ensure that each school is available to test operators in the application.

To manage test operators or site lists, go to `https://rapidtestingapp.org/` and click **Sign in**. Select your program from the dropdown menu, enter the email and password associated with the account, and click **Log In**.

From the _Program Admin_ tab, the site's landing page, you can view a list of test operators, view a site list, or access the training materials.

Program administrators must manage test operator accounts at each site. These responsiblities include creating new accounts, deactivating and activating accounts, and keeping track of the current test operator list.
