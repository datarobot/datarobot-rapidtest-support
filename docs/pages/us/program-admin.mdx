# RapidTest for program administrators

Program administrators are responsible for working with schools and coordinating testing programs. Use the RapidTest web application to manage test operator accounts and ensure that each school is available to test operators in the application.

<br />

To manage test operators or site lists, go to `https://rapidtestingapp.org/` and click **Sign in**. Select your program from the dropdown menu, enter the email and password associated with the account, and click **Log In**.

<br />

From the _Program Admin_ tab, the site's landing page, you can view a list of test operators, view a site list, or access the training materials.

## Managing test operators

Program administrators must manage test operator accounts at each site. These responsibilities include creating new accounts, deactivating and activating accounts, and keeping track of the current test operator list.

<br />

To manage test operators, click the **Test Operators** tab. The _Manage Accounts_ page displays a list of all active and inactive test operators with their name, email, date they were added, and status.

### Adding test operators

Adding new test operators to RapidTest is a primary responsibility of a program administrator. When a new test operator requests an account, make sure they provide a first name, last name, email, and phone number (optional).

<br />

To create an account for a new test operator:

1. Click the **Add a new account** icon.

Monitor the status of their account from the **Manage Accounts** page.

### Adding multiple test operators

If a list of new test operators already exists, you can upload a CSV file to create multiple accounts at once.

<br />

To add multiple test operators:

1. Click the **Upload a list** icon.

      ![Upload a list](images/admin-testop-5.png)

2. Prepare a CSV file of new test operators with the three required columns: `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email_address`. Each new account must include information for each column. Click **Download a template file** to use a template with the column names pre-populated.

### Deactivating test operators

In addition to creating test operator accounts, program administrators are also responsible for deactivating accounts of test operators who no longer want to participate or if there is a change in test operator policy.

<br />

To deactivate a test operator:

1. Locate the test operator you need to deactivate using the search bar.
2. Select the test operator and click the **Deactivate** icon. The test operator's status now displays _Inactive_.

If you deactivated the wrong test operator, select the operator and click the **Activate** icon to change their status back to _Active_.

### Downloading a test operator list

Program administrators can download a list of all test operators as a CSV file. If not specified, the export includes test operators with the status Active, Inactive, and Pending. To download a list of test operators with a specific status, select a status option at the top of the page.

<br />

Click the **Export data** icon.

The CSV file includes each test operator's id, name, email, phone number, and archive status. If the **archive** field is _FALSE_, the test operator is active in the system, and if the field is _TRUE_, the test operator is inactive.

### Resending a welcome email

If a test operator never received a welcome email or deleted it, it can be resent on the _Manage Accounts_ page. Test operators who have not activated their account have the status _Pending_.

1. Locate test operator using the search bar.
2. Select the test operator and click the **Resend Email** icon.

Program administrators are responsible for making sure each site in their program is available to test operators in the application as well as deactivating sites that leave the program.

<br />

To manage sites, click the **Sites** tab. The _Manage Sites_ page displays a list of all active and inactive sites with their name, address, district, contact (if available), and status.

### Deactivating a site

In addition to adding sites, program administrators are also responsible for deactivating sites that are no longer participating in the program or if there is a change in site policy.

To deactivate a site:

1. Find the site you need to deactivate using the search bar.
2. Select the site and click **Deactivate** or click to disable the Status toggle.

### Downloading a site list

Program administrators can download a list of all active and inactive sites as a CSV file.

The CSV file includes information for each site as well as its archive status. If the **archive** field is _FALSE_, the site is active in the system, and if the field is _TRUE_, the site is inactive.
