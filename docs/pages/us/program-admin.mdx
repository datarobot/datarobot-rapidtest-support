# RapidTest overview

Schools provide a critical outlet for children through education, safety, nutrition, behavioral health care, and social interaction. Although incredible efforts have been made to transition to virtual learning, in-person instruction remains essential for children, their families, and communities, so as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, finding ways to safely reopen schools for in-person learning is a pressing need.

Conducting rapid COVID-19 antigen tests onsite at schools for assurance and symptomatic-induced testing is a cost effective, easy, and reliable way to ensure staff and student safety.

Utilizing [rapid COVID-19 antigen tests](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152a3.htm) requires adherence to state and federal reporting regulations instructing test administrators to report all test results to the relevant health authorities in a timely manner. Schools are encouraged to use technologies that ease administrative burdens and comply with reporting requirements. The information found in this guide includes the steps required to successfully develop an application-supported testing program at K-12 schools that keeps teachers and children safe.

Implementing a COVID-19 reporting application can be done in four steps:

1. Create the testing initiative to acquire test kits, plan tests, and gain approval to administer tests onsite.
2. Select the right testing application and implementation method that meets the requirements of your environment and available resources.
3. Implement the technical architecture to support the collection and transmission of test results.
4. Launch the test program with the necessary training.

## Roles and responsibilities

K-12 COVID testing requires several levels of oversight and coordination: school district, county/city, local, and state. Alignment at each level is essential for a successful end-to-end testing and reporting program.

### State responsibilities

State sponsors identify local testing sponsors (e.g. counties and hospitals).

    <td><ul><li>Provide technology funding</li><li>Procure and distribute tests for local sponsors</li></ul></td>
    <td><ul><li>Technical implementation</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Local responsibilities

Local testing sponsors coordinate test administration with school districts, design test administration strategies, and provide supporting training to leads at districts and schools.

### District responsibilities

School districts identify schools, coordinate district-wide test distribution and prioritization, and train school program leads on test administration and reporting.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Project manager / lead</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><ul><li>Provide program manager with the list of participating schools in their district</li><li>Provide program manager with the list of test administrators in their district</li><li>Coordinate district-wide test distribution and request additional tests from the program manager</li><li>Train school program leads on test administration and reporting and coordinate school training sessions</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### School responsibilities

Schools provide staff to administer tests, establish program communications with parents, and conduct supplementary training for new test administrators.
