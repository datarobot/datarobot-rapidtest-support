# Welcome to Relay by Puppet

Relay helps you automate your applications and infrastructure using simple workflows.

If you're using Relay for the first time, follow our [Getting started](getting-started.md) guide to familiarize yourself with key Relay concepts and learn your way around.

To start authoring your own Relay workflows, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you've got an activated account and can [log in to the Relay service](https://app.relay.sh).
2. Install the [Relay command line interface](https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay#installation).
3. (Optional) [Set up your editor](developers/setting-up-editor.md) for Relay authoring. Although this is optional, it 
   makes editing workflows a lot easier!
4. [Pick a reference workflow](reference-workflows.md) to use as a starting point.
5. Modify your reference workflow to your heart's desire, then [run it on Relay](using-workflows/running-a-workflow.md).
