          <p>
            As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, finding ways to safely reopen
            schools for in-person learning is a pressing need. Schools provide a
            critical outlet for children through education, safety, nutrition,
            behavioral health care and important social interaction.

            The information found in the training materials will outline the

        <p>
          Conducting rapid COVID-19 antigen tests at schools for assurance and
          symptom-induced testing is a cost effective, easy, and reliable way to
          ensure student and staff safety.
